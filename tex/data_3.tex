\chapter{Mass and Inertia Data}

\section{Structure Groups Breakdown}

Inertia tensor and center of mass coordinates can be estimated by breaking down empty aircraft into structure groups and then estimating their weights, inertia moments and coordinates, e.g.Â using aircraft drawing. \cite{Torenbeek1982}

\section{OpenVSP}

Mass Properties tool of the OpenVSP can be used to compute aircraft center of mass position and inertia tensor.
