The original Blue Marble is a photo taken by Apollo 17 astronauts on their way to the Moon on December 7th, 1972. In 2005 NASA released a series of satellite imagery of the entire Earth called Blue Marble Next Generation (BMNG). \cite{Terrain-Stockli2005}

Blue Marble Next Generation data is available in georeferenced TIFF (GeoTIFF) file format.

Blue Marble Next Generation data is in the public domain in the United States because it is a work of the United States Federal Government under the terms of Title 17, Chapter 1, Section 105 of the Code of Laws of the United States of America.

Blue Marble Next Generation includes:

\end{figure}

Landsat is a joint USGS ans NASA program to obtain satellite imagery of Earth. Data from Landsat 7 satellite Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor can be used to obtain Earth true‑color imagery. Data covers most of Earth land area.

Bands 1-4 can be used to generate true-color imagery while band 8 can be used to enhance resolution.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ l | c | c }
      \toprule
      \textbf{Band} & \textbf{Wavelength} & \textbf{Resolution} \\ \midrule

USGS High Resolution Orthoimagery (HRO) is a collections of aerial photographs with resolution 1 m/pixel or finer, managed and distributed by the USGS EROS Center. Since data came from multiple vendors, resolution, area of coverage, projection, etc. varies.

High Resolution Orthoimagery digital products are distributed in georeferenced TIFF (GeoTIFF) file format.

\section{Shuttle Radar Topography Mission}

Shuttle Radar Topography Mission was conducted in February 2000 during STS-99 on board of the Space Shuttle Endeavour. Its purpose was to obtain high resolution digital elevation models of most of the Earth surface.

The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data is available in two resolutions, 1 arc second resolution (approximately 30 m/pixel) and 3 arc seconds  resolution ( approximately 90 m/pixel).

The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data is distributed as georeferenced TIFF (GeoTIFF) files arranged into tiles, each covering one degree of latitude and one degree of longitude, named according to their south western corners.
