\section{Coordinate Systems Used for Rotor Calculations}

\subsection{Rotor Axis System}

Origin of the Rotor Axis System is coincident with the rotor hub center, the x-axis is positive forwards, the y-axis is positive right and z-axis is positive downwards and it is coincident with the rotor shaft axis.

\subsection{Rotor-Wind Axis System}

Rotor-Wind Axis System is very much like Rotor Axis System, the only difference is that it is rotated about z-axis in such a manner that x-axis points directly into relative wind, so there is no lateral airspeed component.

\subsection{Control Axis System}

For most purposes, using the Rotor Axis System causes unnecessary complications. It is convenient to use no cyclic feathering axes system. \cite{GessowMyers1985} Origin of the Control Axis System is coincident with the origin of the Rotor Axis System, but it is rotated by angles of the swashplate roll and pitch so there is no cyclic feathering in this coordinate system.

\subsection{Disc Axis System}

Origin of the Disc Axis System is coincident with the origin of the Rotor Axis System, but it is rotated by angles of the rotor cone roll and pitch in such a manner that z-axis is perpendicular to the tip path plane so there is no cyclic flapping in this coordinate system.

\subsection{Control-Wind Axis System}

Control-Wind Axis System is very much like Control Axis System, the only difference is that it is rotated about z-axis in such a manner that x-axis points directly into relative wind, so there is no lateral airspeed component.

\subsection{Blade Axis System}

Blade Axis System is a coordinate system fixed to the rotor blade, its origin is coincident with the intersection point of blade feathering and flapping hinges axes. The x-axis is coincident with blade feathering axis and pointing outwards, the y-axis lies on XY plane of the Control Axis System and points towards blade leading edge, while the z-axis completes a right-handed coordinate system.

\subsection{Individual Blade Coordinates}

Origin of the Individual Blade Coordinates is coincident with the point of intersection of flapping and feathering hinge axes, x-axis is coincident with the blade chord and points towards trailing edge, y-axis is coincident with the feathering hinge axis and it is positive towards blade tip, while the z-axis completes a right-handed coordinate system.

Neglecting blade flapping motions occuring more frequent than once per revolution flapping angle can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\beta \left( \Psi \right)
=
\beta_0 + \beta_{1c} \cos \Psi + \beta_{1s} \sin \Psi 
\end{equation}
