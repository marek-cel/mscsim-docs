\section{Aerodynamic Characteristics Approximation}

Following approximation is used to get lift coefficient for the full range of angle of attack. \cite{NASA-TM-102267}

Lift coefficient is given by the following expressions:
\begin{align}
  C_L =
  -
  \frac{
    \left( \alpha + \alpha_{L2} \right)
    \left( \alpha + \cfrac{\pi}{2} \right) 
  }
  {
    \left( \alpha_{L1} - \alpha_{L2} \right)
    \left( \alpha_{L1} - \cfrac{\pi}{2} \right) 
  }
\end{align}
